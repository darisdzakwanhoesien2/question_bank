      "question": "Why can't the sRGB color space reproduce all visible colors?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Because the sRGB primaries are positioned within the chromaticity diagram, restricting reproducible colors to those inside the triangle they define",
        "B": "Because sRGB uses a limited bit depth, preventing it from representing a wide range of colors accurately",
        "C": "Because sRGB relies on outdated color measurement techniques, reducing its ability to cover the full spectrum of visible colors",
        "D": "Because sRGB does not include a luminance component, making it unable to represent certain shades and tints",

      "question": "Color is typically described using three primaries, but why do we only need two parameters to represent chromaticity?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Because human vision merges two of the tristimulus values into a single dimension, leaving only two separate parameters to describe color fully",
        "B": "Because two parameters are chosen for mathematical simplicity, even though all three primaries remain independently significant to color perception",
        "C": "Because defining chromaticity traditionally omits the blue primary, reducing the necessary dimensions from three to two",
        "D": "Because chromaticity is defined by normalizing the three tristimulus values by their sum, making one coordinate dependent on the other two",
        "E": "Because one of the primaries always remains constant, removing the need for a third parameter in describing chromaticity"

        "A": "Because color histograms prioritize central image colors, reducing the impact of surrounding areas during spatial transformations",
        "B": "Because color histograms adjust color values based on geometric transformations, compensating for any changes in position or orientation",
        "C": "Because color histograms utilize transformation-invariant features that realign colors after any spatial modification",
        "D": "Because color histograms ignore the spatial arrangement of pixels and focus solely on the distribution of colors",
