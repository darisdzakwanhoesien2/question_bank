Present the full camera matrix \\(P = K [R \\; t]\\) and explain each component of the intrinsic matrix \\(K\\) (focal length, principal point, skew, pixel aspect ratio). Discuss the role of extrinsic parameters and the decomposition of \\(P\\). Then, cover real-world deviations: radial and tangential lens distortion models, and their parameterization (k1, k2, p1, p2). Describe the standard calibration procedure using multiple views of a checkerboard pattern, including corner detection, homography estimation, and nonlinear optimization. Finally, discuss limitations of the pinhole model (finite aperture blur, rolling shutter, chromatic aberration) and advanced models (rational polynomial, fisheye). Include mathematical formulations and practical implications for downstream tasks like 3D reconstruction and augmented reality.",
