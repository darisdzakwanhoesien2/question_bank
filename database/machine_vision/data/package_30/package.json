"prompt": "Triangulation using 1D cameras. The projection function for a 1D camera is m ∝ P x, where m = [m, 1]^T (pixel in homogeneous coords), x = [x, y, 1]^T (2D world point in homogeneous coords) and P is a 2×3 projection matrix. (a) Given two cameras P1 and P2 and their measurements m1 and m2 of an unknown point x, derive the constraints on x in the form A x = b (A is 2×2, b is 2×1). Express A and b in terms of P1, P2 and the measurements. (b) Given P1 = [[1,2,0],[2,1,0]] and P2 = [[1,2,3],[4,2,0]] and measurements m1 = 1.25 and m2 = 1, triangulate the point x (solve for x and y). (c) A point is often observed in many images: is there an advantage to estimating the point’s position by considering all images simultaneously? Justify. (d) Many points are observed in an image: is there an advantage to estimating all points jointly instead of independently? Justify.",
