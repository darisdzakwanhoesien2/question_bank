    "prompt": "Explain the complete pipeline for binary image analysis as presented in the lecture. Start with the motivation for binarization and the challenges posed by real-world imaging conditions (e.g., lighting, sensor noise). Describe global and adaptive thresholding methods, their assumptions, and failure cases. Then, detail the role of connectivity (4- vs 8-connected) and the two-pass connected component labeling algorithm using provisional labels and equivalence resolution. Finally, discuss morphological post-processing (opening, closing) with structuring elements to clean up noise and fill holes, and conclude with applications such as document OCR or object counting. Include mathematical definitions where appropriate (e.g., erosion, dilation).",
