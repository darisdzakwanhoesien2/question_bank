Start with light-surface interaction (body vs. interface reflection) and derive the linear clustering property in RGB space for neutral interface reflection (NIR). Describe how this enables specular highlight detection and removal using pixel clustering or line fitting. Then, discuss computational color constancy: define the problem, explain the Gray World and White Patch assumptions, and their limitations under colored illuminants or non-Lambertian surfaces. Compare RGB-based methods with learning-based approaches (e.g., gamut mapping). Conclude with the role of color in higher-level vision tasks (segmentation, recognition) and challenges posed by sensor metamerism.",
