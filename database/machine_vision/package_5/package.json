Define the concepts of slant and tilt and describe how isotropic texture is distorted under perspective projection.

Discuss the isotropy and homogeneity assumptions, their geometric implications, and common violations in real scenes. Compare shape from texture with shape from shading in terms of input requirements, robustness, and output (qualitative vs. metric).
