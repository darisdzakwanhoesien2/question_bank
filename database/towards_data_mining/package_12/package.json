    "prompt": "Answer **all five** questions below. Each question is worth **6 points** (total 30 points). Use concepts directly from the 2017 'Towards Data Mining' exam. Answers must be clear, technically accurate, and concise.\n\n**1. Term Definitions (6 × 1p = 6p)**\nDefine each term briefly in the context of data mining and machine learning:\n   a. Predictive model\n   b. Data pollution\n   c. Numerosity reduction\n   d. Accuracy paradox\n   e. Validation set\n   f. Missing not at random (MNAR) missingness mechanism\n\n**2. Information Privacy in Data Mining (3 × 2p = 6p)**\n   a. Explain the concept of *information privacy* and how it differs from classical privacy (2p).\n   b. How is data mining a potential threat to information privacy? Give one example (2p).\n   c. Name **two** strategies to protect information privacy during data mining and briefly explain how each works (2p).\n\n**3. Data Collection Strategy (2p + 4p = 6p)**\nYou want to collect data from 100 persons about shopping habits.\n   a. How should you choose the persons to ensure the model generalizes to the entire population? (2p)\n   b. Design a complete **data collection plan** including: sampling method, sample size justification, and at least two bias mitigation techniques (4p).\n\n**4. Ensuring Model Generalizability (3 × 2p = 6p)**\nHow would you divide a dataset into training and testing sets to ensure model generalizability in the following scenarios?\n   a. The dataset is small.\n   b. Some variables are time-dependent.\n   c. The data comes from multiple individuals.\n\n**5. Data Quality Characteristics (6p)**\nList and explain **all** characteristics that define *data quality*. For each characteristic, provide **one concrete example** of how its absence can harm a predictive model.",
