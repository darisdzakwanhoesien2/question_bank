{

"question": "Which of the following best describes a limitation of 'informed consent' in the context of data mining, as discussed in the lecture slides?",
"options": {
"A": "Informed consent is always sufficient because once users agree they waive all privacy rights.",
"B": "Informed consent may be insufficient because data mining can discover unforeseen sensitive information that could not be fully described to subjects in advance.",
"C": "Informed consent is unnecessary when datasets are anonymised because anonymisation removes all privacy risk.",
"D": "Informed consent is only required for data collected in clinical trials, not for routine digital traces."

"question": "Which anonymisation approach (mentioned in the slides) explicitly requires that each released record be indistinguishable from at least k-1 other records with respect to a set of quasi-identifiers?",

"A": "Pseudonymisation",
"B": "k-anonymity",

"id": "pkg1_mcq3",
"question": "According to the lecture slides, which statement correctly contrasts relational databases and document-oriented NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB)?",
"options": {
"A": "Relational databases permit embedded documents and lack a fixed schema, while MongoDB enforces a strict schema across all documents.",
"B": "Relational databases provide a standardised query language (SQL) and strong schema constraints; document stores offer flexible schemas but less standardisation.",
"C": "Document stores always provide stronger consistency guarantees than relational databases.",
"D": "Relational databases are unsuitable for any scalable or distributed use; NoSQL databases are the only scalable option."
