"prompt": "Discuss the key methodological, ethical, and practical considerations in planning and conducting a human-centered data collection study (such as the wearable-sensor gym activity project presented in the lecture). Your answer should: (1) describe how to plan for repeatability, reproducibility, and accuracy; (2) outline how ethical concerns such as informed consent, privacy, and risk-benefit balance should be addressed; and (3) suggest strategies for mitigating technical and human-related data collection problems.",
