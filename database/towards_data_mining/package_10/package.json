    "prompt": "Answer the following comprehensive question based on the 2017 exam content (total 100 points):\n\n**1. Key Definitions (6 points)**\nExplain each term briefly in the context of data mining and machine learning:\n   a. Predictive model\n   b. Data pollution\n   c. Numerosity reduction\n   d. Accuracy paradox\n   e. Validation set\n   f. Missing not at random (MNAR) missingness mechanism\n\n**2. Information Privacy (6 points)**\n   a. Explain the concept of *information privacy* and how it differs from the classical notion of privacy.\n   b. How is data mining a potential threat to information privacy?\n   c. What can be done to protect information privacy in data mining?\n\n**3. Data Collection Strategy (6 points)**\nYou want to collect data from 100 persons about shopping habits.\n   a. How should you choose the persons to make a model that works for everyone?\n   b. Make a data collection plan (include sampling method, sample size justification, and bias mitigation).\n\n**4. Dataset Design for Generalization (6 points)**\nHow would you divide a dataset for training and testing to ensure model generalizability in the following cases?\n   a. The dataset available is small.\n   b. Some of the variables are time-dependent.\n   c. There is data from multiple individuals.\n\n**5. Data Quality (6 points)**\nWhat are the characteristics that define *data quality*? Provide examples for each.\n\n**Bonus Integration (10 points)**\nConnect concepts from questions 1–5: Explain how poor data quality (e.g., MNAR missingness) can lead to violations of information privacy, and how proper validation and numerosity reduction help mitigate both issues.",
